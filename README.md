# Rock Paper Scissors in Python!

### Pick your weapon and play against the computer - you'll only get a virtual sting if you lose!

Prerequisites: All you need is [Python 3](http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0) to play.

Clone the project, navigate to the correct directory- <code>cd directory name</code> - and run the game.py file in a python 3 terminal window for mac/linux.

The rules are the same as the classic game:

1. Paper covers Rock
2. Scissors cuts Paper
3. Rock smashes Scissors

**Choose Your weapon wisely!**

The computer chooses first, just follow the prompts.
